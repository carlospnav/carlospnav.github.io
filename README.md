# Carlos Navarrete's Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio website. It will be under construction until I finish Udacity's nanodegree. When
it's ready it should serve as a demonstration of my improvements in Web Development and Design in general. I am currently in the process of developing other projects which should be hosted in this site when I'm finished.
