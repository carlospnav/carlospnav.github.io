# Carlos Navarrete's Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio website. It will be under construction until I finish Udacity's nanodegree. When
it's ready it should serve as a demonstration of my improvements in Web Development and Design in general. I am currently in the process of developing other projects which should be hosted in this site when I'm finished. 

##To-do List:
1. Finish redesigning the visual identity of the page.
  1. Work on the overarching design of the page.  (Currently working on this).
  2. Adapt it to different devices.
  3. Save as mock in the project.
2. Add the portfolio information to the page.
3. Pick a frontend framework and integrate it to the website.
4. Synchronize the photography section with the interactive map. 
5. Add support to my small game project.
